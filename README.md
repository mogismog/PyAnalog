PyAnalog
========

Module used to generate weather forecasts based on analogs. Mixes Python and Fortran 90 subroutines.

Requires:

NumPy (mainly f2py),
Matplotlib


More to come, but this is part of a bigger project! This also serves as example code.

TODO:

Fix up the setup.py file
Finish writing things like the verification aspect, maybe add in an option for reliability?
